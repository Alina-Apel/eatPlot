\arguments{
\item{no_trend_list}{Input is a list prepared by \code{\link[=prep_no_trend]{prep_no_trend()}}. You can also use the according data.frame named \code{plot_bar} from this list.}

\item{x_value}{Character string of the column name containing the estimates that should be plotted on the x-axis. Defaults to \code{"est_wholeGroup"}, which are the estimates for the comparison of a state against the wholeGroup (Germany).}

\item{y_value}{Character string of the column name containing the labels that should be plotted on the y-axis. Defaults to \code{"state_var"}, so the states (Bundesl√§nder) are depicted on the y-axis.}

\item{bar_pattern}{Character string of the column containing the grouping for the pattern on the bar. Defaults to \code{sig_wholeGroup}, so the significances of the state vs. wholeGroup (Germany) comparison are represented in the pattern of the bars.}

\item{bar_fill}{Character string of the column containing the grouping for the filling of the bar. Defaults to \code{fill_wholeGroup}, so the significances of the state vs. wholeGroup (Germany) comparison, as well as the groups found in "data$grouping_var" are represented in the filling colours of the bars.}

\item{bar_pattern_fill}{Character string of the column containing the grouping for the filling of the pattern on the bar. Defaults to \code{fill_wholeGroup}, so the groups found in "data$grouping_var" are represented in the colours of the bar pattern.}

\item{bar_pattern_setting}{Named vector with the pattern types. Names of the vector must be found in the column specified in \code{bar_pattern}. Defaults to ...}

\item{bar_fill_setting}{Named vector with the bar filling colours. Names of the vector must be found in the column specified in \code{bar_fill}. Defaults to ...}

\item{bar_pattern_fill_setting}{Named vector with the filling colours for the bar pattern. Names of the vector must be found in the column specified in \code{bar_pattern_fill}. Defaults to ...}

\item{sig_pattern}{Character string indicating whether groups should be rendered by pattern fill ("pattern") or line type ("frame"). Defaults to "pattern".}
