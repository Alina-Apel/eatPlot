\title{Build labels with significances represented in bold or as raised 'a', and, if wanted, standard errors in brackets. Main usage for plotting tables and brace labels.}
\usage{
construct_label(
  dat,

  label_est = NULL,
  label_se = NULL,
  label_sig_bold = NULL,
  label_sig_high = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Dataframe with the columns that should be merged into labels.}

\item{new_name}{Character string for the new column that is added to \code{dat}. Defaults to \code{'label'}.}

\item{label_est}{Character string of the column name containing the brace labels.}

\item{label_se}{Character string of the column name containing the standard errors for \code{label_est}. Will be put in bracktes behind \code{label_est}.}

\item{label_sig_bold}{Character string of the column name containing significance values for \code{label_est}. Significant values will be marked as bold.}

\item{label_sig_high}{Character string of the column name containing significance values for \code{label_est}. Significant values will be marked by a raised 'a'.}

\item{round_est}{Rounding of label_est.}

\item{round_se}{Rounding of label_se.}
}
\value{
The data.frame with an added column for the constructed label.
